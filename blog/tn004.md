With OS X 10.6.3 it’s not possible anymore to limit the size of TM
backups by precreating the TM image with a fixed size.

With the OS X 10.6.3 Update Apple has
introduced a new feature into TimeMachine: as soon as TM starts up and
mounts the AFP volume with the TM image, it checks whether the image
size matches the sizes of the underlying AFP volume. If the image is
smaller, it gets resized to the size of the AFP volume. Therefore it’s
not possible anymore to limit the size of TM backups by precreating the
TM image with a fixed size.

The upcoming release of Netatalk 2.1 will have a new volume option
***volsizelimit*** which can be used to
present the AFP client a fake volume size.

*Editor's note:* This volume option was renamed to ***vol size limit***
in Netatalk 3.0 onwards.
