## Bug Reports

If you think you have found a bug in Netatalk, first see if the bug has already been reported in the
[Netatalk issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/issues).

If no similar bug has been reported yet, please
[create a new ticket](https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/issues/new/choose)
and provide as much context as possible, including Netatalk version, OS
version, contents of configuration files, and debug or backtrace logs.

In the case you cannot use GitHub to report the bug, please use the *netatalk-admins* mailing list
as described below instead.

## Technical Support

If you want to get help from the Netatalk developers or the community,
or simply want to share a cool idea, you can start a new topic at
[Netatalk Discussions](https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/discussions)
at GitHub. Please don't forget to be courteous and mindful of others.

## Mailing Lists

The [netatalk-admins mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/netatalk/mailman/netatalk-admins/)
is a place where project admins and the general public can discuss any netatalk topic.
You can use it to report bugs or contribute patches if GitHub is not an opion.
Release announcements are posted here as well.

There are other historical mailing lists on the same platform, but they are read-only archives.

## Security

See the [Netatalk Security Policy](/security.html) for a list of security vulnerability advisories,
as well as information on reporting security issues to the project.
