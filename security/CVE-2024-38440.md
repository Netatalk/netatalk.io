# Netatalk Security Advisory

| **Subject**  | Heap out-of-bounds write in uams_dhx_pam.c |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **CVE ID#**  | [CVE-2024-38440](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38440) |
| **Date**     | 2024/06/28 |
| **Versions** | 3.2.0, 3.0.0 - 3.1.18, 1.5.0 - 2.4.0 |
| **Summary**  | Lack of user input validation can lead to an out-of-bounds heap write |

## Description

The vulnerability originates in *uams_dhx_pam.c*
and is caused by insufficient validation
of the length field after parsing user input,
leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of a single byte (\0)

In specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata from the
next heap block, which may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain
heap layouts or when ASAN is enabled.

## Patch Availability

to hotfix your local Netatalk deployment.

Additionally, Netatalk 2.4.1, 3.1.19, and 3.2.1 have been released which
include the security patch. Netatalk administrators are advised to
upgrade to this version or apply the patch as soon as possible.
